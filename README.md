# Memory-game
This project is a simple Memory Game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The objective of the game is to find all the matching pairs of cards. The game board consists of 16 cards arranged in a 4x4 grid, with each card having a front and back side.

## Features

- 4x4 grid of cards
- Each card has a unique letter from A-H
- Cards flip to reveal their letters
- Matching pairs remain face up
- Non-matching pairs flip back after a short delay
- Game ends when all pairs are matched.

## Game Instructions

1. Click on any two cards to flip them over and reveal the letters on their back sides.
2. If the letters on the two flipped cards match, those cards will remain face up.
3. If the letters do not match, the cards will flip back over to their face-down position after a short delay.
4. Continue flipping pairs of cards until all matching pairs have been found.
5. You win the game when all pairs have been successfully matched and all cards are face up.

## Tips

- Try to remember the positions and letters of previously flipped cards to find matches more efficiently.
- Start by flipping over different pairs each time to gain more information about the card positions.
